# Archived

It was fun while it lasted, but we have to stop maintaining these repositories. We haven't used these projects for quite some time and maintaining them is becoming harder to do.

You deserve better, and for that reason we've decided to archive some repositories, which includes this one.

Feel free to fork and alter the repositories, and go forth making awesome stuff.

> ACL for your aurelia application.

Simple and small. Set permissions, and then use the provided tools to verify them.

## Installation

### Jspm

Run `jspm i aurelia-acl` from your project root.

And add following to the `bundles.dist.aurelia.includes` section of `build/bundles.js`:

```js
  "aurelia-acl"
```

If the installation results in having forks, try resolving them by running:

```sh
jspm inspect --forks
jspm resolve --only registry:package-name@version
```

## Configuration

The most basic way to configure your permissions is by passing them as an object literal. More configuration options can
 be found on the [documentation](./configure.md);


```js
aurelia.use
   .plugin('aurelia-acl', {
     chat: ['read', 'post'],
     statistics: true // grants access to all statistics
   });
```

## Usage

```html
<template>
  <chatbox allowed="{chat: 'read'}"></chatbox>
</template>
```

The `chatbox` is only visible when acl is granted for `chat.read`.

## Documentation

You can find detailed documentation, including installation instructions over at the [aurelia-acl documentation](http://aurelia-acl.spoonx.org/).

The [changelog](https://aurelia-acl.spoonx.org/CHANGELOG.html) provides you with information about important changes made over releases.
